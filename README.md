Abstract

SmartIndus is an embedded IoT-based system for real-time industrial machine monitoring and automated anomaly detection. It uses the STM32F407ZG microcontroller with a current sensor and Wi-Fi ESP Click for data transmission. When abnormal current levels are detected, the system sends an instant alert via EmailJS. Developed in NECTO Studio, SmartIndus ensures reliability, scalability, and easy integration for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0 environments.
